A clean, minimalistic administration theme based on Twitter's Bootstrap

== Description ==

A clean, minimalistic administration theme implementing Twitter's Bootstrap.
You can watch the development on github: https://github.com/nerdzgr/bootstrap-admin
If you want to learn more about bootstrap go ahead and take a look here: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap

This project was built for the http://openstores.gr network of stores.
This plugin will continue to be improved.

So far these things have been done:

* General styling of the wordpress admin area
* Admin menu sub-menus as bootstrap popovers (they're actually very beautiful!)
* Bootstrap Icons for a lot of things
* Default WordPress forms theming
* Buttons theming
* Postboxes theming
* Includes WPMUdev Pro-Sites optimizations
* Includes WPMUdev MarketPress optimizations
* Even more, and a lot more on the way!
* Styling is done using LESS.
* Implements [chosen js](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ "chosen js")

== Installation ==

Just copy to your plugins folder and activate (or Network activate) it.

Styling is done using less. This Plugin includes phpless http://leafo.net/lessphp/ 
If you want to use less when theming this plugin, you should open the config.php file and
change this line

`define('BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_LESS_MODE', '0');`

from '0' to '1'. 
This will tell the less preprocessor to re-compile the stylesheet 
every time a change is detected on our less file.
When you're done theming, please change it back to '0' to speed-up your admin section.
(though it's not resources-heavy, phpless is still one more script that runs). 
If you are not theming using less, keep this option to '0'.

To disable chosen js, you can change
`define('BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_CHOSEN_JS', '1');'
from '1' to '0'.
