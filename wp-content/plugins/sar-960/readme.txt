SAR 960 provides functionality for the 960gs in the wordpress editor.

== Description ==

The SAR 960 plugin provides shortcodes to create 960gs columns easily in the wordpress editor.

Shortcodes can be used for all manner of 960gs combinations based on the 12 column grid layout.

Quickly add columns to your pages from the editor with an easy to use "pick n' click" interface!

<b>Example</b>
To create content with 3 columns, you would use the shortcodes like this:

[960_4]this is column 1[/960_4]

[960_4]this is column 2[/960_4]

[960_4]this is column 3[/960_4]

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin and use the shortcodes [960_1], [960_2] all the way to [960_12].
